            <h2>Biography</h2>
            <p><b>Alan Turing</b> was a brilliant British mathematician who took a leading role in breaking Nazi ciphers during WWII. In his seminal 1936 paper, he proved that there cannot exist any universal algorithmic method of determining truth in mathematics, and that mathematics will always contain undecidable propositions. His work is widely acknowledged as foundational research of computer science and artificial intelligence.</p>
            <p>English scientist Alan Turing was born Alan Mathison Turing on June 23, 1912, in Maida Vale, London, England. At a young age, he displayed signs of high intelligence, which some of his teachers recognized, but did not necessarily respect. When Turing attended the well-known independent Sherborne School at the age of 13, he became particularly interested in math and science.</p>
            <p>After Sherborne, Turing enrolled at King's College (University of Cambridge) in Cambridge, England, studying there from 1931 to 1934. As a result of his dissertation, in which he proved the central limit theorem, Turing was elected a fellow at the school upon his graduation.</p>
            <p>In 1936, Turing delivered a paper, <em>"On Computable Numbers, with an Application to the Entscheidungsproblem,"</em> in which he presented the notion of a universal machine (later called the <em>â€œUniversal Turing Machine,"</em> and then the <em>"Turing machine"</em>) capable of computing anything that is computable: It is considered the precursor to the modern computer.</p>
            <p>Over the next two years, Turing studied mathematics and cryptology at the Institute for Advanced Study in Princeton, New Jersey. After receiving his Ph.D. from Princeton University in 1938, he returned to Cambridge, and then took a part-time position with the Government Code and Cypher School, a British code-breaking organization.</p>
